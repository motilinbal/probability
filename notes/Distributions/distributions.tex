\begin{abstract}
These notes explore a powerful perspective for learning and understanding common probability distributions. Instead of treating each distribution as an isolated entity to be memorized, we will focus on the rich tapestry of relationships and connections that link them together. By understanding the "story" of how one distribution relates to or arises from another, we can develop deeper intuition and a more robust, lasting comprehension. This approach mirrors the insights presented in a helpful explanatory video, which we will elaborate upon here with appropriate mathematical formalism and context for our course.

\section{Motivation: Beyond Rote Memorization}

Often, when encountering the "zoo" of probability distributions, students feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of formulas (PMFs, PDFs, CDFs, means, variances) to memorize. While knowing these properties is important, true understanding comes from seeing the bigger picture. How are these distributions related? What fundamental ideas do they model?

\begin{analogy}[Learning Complex Patterns vs. Underlying Rules]
Imagine being asked to memorize a long, complex sequence of colored blocks, say, blue and yellow. Memorizing the exact sequence 'Blue, Yellow, Yellow, Blue, Yellow, Blue, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow, Blue...' is tedious and prone to error.

However, suppose you are told the *rule* generating the sequence: "Record the color after each coin flip (Heads=Blue, Tails=Yellow)." Suddenly, the sequence makes sense; it's a realization of Bernoulli trials. Or perhaps the rule is: "Keep drawing blocks until you see the first Blue one, and record the sequence of Yellows drawn before it." This rule generates sequences related to the Geometric distribution.

The insight here is powerful: **understanding the underlying generative process or relationship is far more effective than memorizing the surface-level pattern.** This principle applies directly to learning probability distributions.
\end{analogy}

Our goal, therefore, is not just to list distributions but to weave a narrative connecting them. We'll start with the simplest building block and see how more complex and continuous distributions emerge naturally.

\section{The Core Narrative: From Bernoulli to Poisson}

Let's build a story connecting several fundamental discrete and continuous distributions.

\subsection{The Building Block: The Bernoulli Trial}

The simplest non-trivial random experiment has only two outcomes, often labeled "success" and "failure".

\begin{definition}[Bernoulli Distribution]
A random variable $X$ follows a **Bernoulli distribution** with parameter $p$ (where $0 \le p \le 1$), denoted $X \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)$, if its probability mass function (PMF) is:
$$ P(X=k) = \begin{cases} p & \text{if } k=1 \quad (\text{"success"}) \\ 1-p & \text{if } k=0 \quad (\text{"failure"}) \end{cases} $$
Here, $p$ represents the probability of success.
\end{definition}

Think of a single coin flip (Heads=$1$, Tails=$0$), checking if a manufactured item is defective (Defective=$1$, Not Defective=$0$), or the state of a single bit (1 or 0). This is our fundamental atom.

\subsection{Waiting for the First Success: The Geometric Distribution}

Now, let's repeat independent Bernoulli trials, all with the same success probability $p$. A natural question arises: how many failures do we observe *before* the very first success?

\begin{definition}[Geometric Distribution]
Let $Y$ be the number of failures before the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials with success probability $p$. Then $Y$ follows a **Geometric distribution** with parameter $p$, denoted $Y \sim \text{Geometric}(p)$. Its PMF is:
$$ P(Y=k) = (1-p)^k p, \quad \text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \dots $$
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
This definition counts the number of *failures*. Some texts define the Geometric distribution to count the number of *trials* (failures + 1 success). Both are valid, but we use the "number of failures" definition here, consistent with the video's framing (counting yellow blocks before the first blue). Always check the convention being used!
\end{remark}

\textit{Connection:} The Geometric distribution is directly built upon the concept of repeated Bernoulli trials, modeling a specific waiting-time scenario.

\subsection{Waiting for Multiple Successes: The Negative Binomial Distribution}

Why stop at the *first* success? Let's generalize. Suppose we want to know how many failures occur before we achieve a predetermined number, say $r$, of successes.

\begin{definition}[Negative Binomial Distribution]
Let $W$ be the number of failures before the $r$-th success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials with success probability $p$. Then $W$ follows a **Negative Binomial distribution** with parameters $r$ (number of successes) and $p$ (success probability), denoted $W \sim \text{NB}(r, p)$. Its PMF is:
$$ P(W=k) = \binom{k+r-1}{k} (1-p)^k p^r = \binom{k+r-1}{r-1} (1-p)^k p^r, \quad \text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \dots $$
\end{definition}

\textit{Connection:} The Negative Binomial is a natural generalization of the Geometric distribution. If we set $r=1$ in the Negative Binomial PMF, we recover the Geometric PMF (since $\binom{k+1-1}{1-1} = \binom{k}{0} = 1$).
$$ \text{Geometric}(p) \equiv \text{NB}(r=1, p) $$
This confirms the narrative: the Negative Binomial extends the "waiting time" concept from one success (Geometric) to $r$ successes.

\subsection{Counting Successes in a Fixed Number of Trials: The Binomial Distribution}

Let's change our perspective. Instead of counting *failures until* successes, let's fix the total number of independent Bernoulli trials, say $n$, and count the total number of *successes* within those $n$ trials.

\begin{definition}[Binomial Distribution]
Let $X$ be the total number of successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials, each with success probability $p$. Then $X$ follows a **Binomial distribution** with parameters $n$ (number of trials) and $p$ (success probability), denoted $X \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p)$. Its PMF is:
$$ P(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}, \quad \text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n $$
\end{definition}

\textit{Connection:} The Binomial distribution also arises from Bernoulli trials, but it answers a different question than the Geometric or Negative Binomial. It focuses on the *count* of successes in a fixed sample size, not the *waiting time* for successes. Notice that a $\text{Binomial}(1, p)$ variable is identical to a $\text{Bernoulli}(p)$ variable.

\subsection{Transitioning to Continuous Time/Space}

The distributions above are *discrete* â€“ they count things (failures, successes). What if we consider events happening in continuous time or space? Imagine the Bernoulli trials happening faster and faster, with the probability of success in any tiny interval becoming proportionally smaller. This conceptual leap leads us to continuous distributions.

\subsection{Continuous Waiting Time for the First Event: The Exponential Distribution}

Consider events occurring randomly over time (e.g., radioactive decays, customer arrivals at a store) such that the average rate of occurrence is constant, say $\lambda$ events per unit time. This describes a Poisson process. The time we wait until the *very first* event occurs follows an Exponential distribution.

\begin{definition}[Exponential Distribution]
A continuous random variable $T$ follows an **Exponential distribution** with rate parameter $\lambda > 0$, denoted $T \sim \text{Exponential}(\lambda)$, if its probability density function (PDF) is:
$$ f(t) = \begin{cases} \lambda e^{-\lambda t} & \text{if } t \ge 0 \\ 0 & \text{if } t < 0 \end{cases} $$
\end{definition}

\textit{Connection (Analogy):} The Exponential distribution is the continuous analogue of the Geometric distribution.
$$ \text{Geometric (failures before 1st success)} \longleftrightarrow \text{Exponential (waiting time for 1st event)} $$
Think of the Geometric as counting discrete "time steps" (failures) before success, while the Exponential measures continuous time before an event. This connection can be made formal through limiting processes involving Bernoulli trials.

\subsection{Continuous Waiting Time for Multiple Events: The Gamma Distribution}

Just as the Negative Binomial generalized the Geometric to wait for $r$ successes, the Gamma distribution generalizes the Exponential to wait for $k$ events in a Poisson process.

\begin{definition}[Gamma Distribution]
A continuous random variable $T_k$ follows a **Gamma distribution** with shape parameter $k > 0$ and rate parameter $\lambda > 0$, denoted $T_k \sim \text{Gamma}(k, \lambda)$, if its PDF is:
$$ f(t) = \begin{cases} \frac{\lambda^k}{\Gamma(k)} t^{k-1} e^{-\lambda t} & \text{if } t \ge 0 \\ 0 & \text{if } t < 0 \end{cases} $$
where $\Gamma(k) = \int_0^\infty x^{k-1} e^{-x} dx$ is the Gamma function. When $k$ is a positive integer, $T_k$ represents the waiting time until the $k$-th event in a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$.
\end{definition}

\textit{Connection (Analogy):} The Gamma distribution is the continuous analogue of the Negative Binomial distribution.
$$ \text{Negative Binomial (failures before r-th success)} \longleftrightarrow \text{Gamma (waiting time for k-th event)} $$
Specifically, $\text{Gamma}(k=1, \lambda) \equiv \text{Exponential}(\lambda)$, just as $\text{NB}(r=1, p) \equiv \text{Geometric}(p)$.

\subsection{Counting Events in a Fixed Interval: The Poisson Distribution}

What about the continuous analogue of counting successes (like the Binomial)? In a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$, the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time (say, of length $t$) follows a Poisson distribution.

\begin{definition}[Poisson Distribution]
A discrete random variable $N$ follows a **Poisson distribution** with parameter (or mean) $\mu > 0$, denoted $N \sim \text{Poisson}(\mu)$, if its PMF is:
$$ P(N=k) = \frac{e^{-\mu} \mu^k}{k!}, \quad \text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \dots $$
If events occur according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$, the number of events in an interval of length $t$ is $\text{Poisson}(\mu = \lambda t)$.
\end{definition}

\textit{Connection (Analogy \& Limit):} The Poisson distribution is often viewed as the limit of the Binomial distribution when the number of trials $n$ is very large, the success probability $p$ is very small, but the expected number of successes, $\mu = np$, remains moderate and constant. % Escaped ampersand corrected previously
$$ \text{Binomial}(n, p) \xrightarrow[n \to \infty, p \to 0]{np = \mu} \text{Poisson}(\mu) $$
This makes the Poisson distribution suitable for modeling the number of rare events occurring in many opportunities.
$$ \text{Binomial (success count in n trials)} \longleftrightarrow \text{Poisson (event count in fixed interval)} $$

\section{Further Insights from Relationships}

Understanding these connections yields deeper insights:

\subsection{Summation Properties}

Some distributions have elegant closure properties under summation of independent samples:

\begin{proposition}[Summation Properties] Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be independent random variables.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $X_i \sim \text{Geometric}(p)$ for all $i$, then $\sum_{i=1}^r X_i$ (sum of failures before 1st success, repeated $r$ times) is related to the waiting time for the $r$-th success. More precisely, if $Y_i$ are i.i.d. Geometric($p$) counting *trials*, then $\sum_{i=1}^r Y_i \sim \text{NB}(r,p)$ counting *trials*. If $X_i$ are i.i.d. Geometric($p$) counting *failures*, then $\sum_{i=1}^r X_i + r$ (total trials) has an NB distribution for total trials. A direct sum interpretation: The number of failures before the $r$-th success ($W \sim \text{NB}(r,p)$) can be seen as the sum of $r$ independent Geometric($p$) random variables representing failures between consecutive successes.
    \item If $X_i \sim \text{Exponential}(\lambda)$ for all $i$, then $\sum_{i=1}^k X_i \sim \text{Gamma}(k, \lambda)$. (The sum of $k$ independent exponential waiting times gives the waiting time for the $k$-th event).
    \item If $X_i \sim \text{Binomial}(n_i, p)$ for all $i$ (note the *same* $p$), then $\sum_{i=1}^m X_i \sim \text{Binomial}(\sum_{i=1}^m n_i, p)$.
    \item If $X_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\mu_i)$ for all $i$, then $\sum_{i=1}^m X_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\sum_{i=1}^m \mu_i)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
These summation properties are incredibly useful in modeling. For example, if customer arrivals follow a Poisson process, the total arrivals over several disjoint time periods also follow a Poisson distribution.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Bonus Connections: A Glimpse Ahead}

The web of relationships extends much further! The video briefly mentioned a few more advanced connections, which you will explore in more detail in later courses (like mathematical statistics or stochastic processes):

\begin{itemize}
    \item **Student's t-distribution:** Arises when estimating the mean of a normally distributed population with an unknown variance. It can be formally derived as a mixture distribution: a Normal distribution whose variance is itself random and follows an Inverse-Gamma distribution. This is crucial in statistical inference.
    \item **Laplace (Double Exponential) Distribution:** This distribution, characterized by its sharp peak at the mean and heavier tails than the Normal distribution, can be generated as the difference of two independent and identically distributed Exponential random variables ($X_1 - X_2$ where $X_1, X_2 \sim \text{i.i.d. Exponential}(\lambda)$).
    \item **Cauchy Distribution:** A rather pathological distribution (it has no defined mean or variance!) that arises surprisingly naturally as the ratio of two independent standard Normal random variables ($Z_1 / Z_2$ where $Z_1, Z_2 \sim \text{i.i.d. Normal}(0, 1)$). It's famous in physics (resonance phenomena) and as a counterexample in statistics.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion: The Power of Connections}

We have journeyed from the simple Bernoulli trial through a sequence of related discrete and continuous distributions, highlighting the "stories" that connect them. We saw how Geometric and Negative Binomial relate to waiting times for successes, how the Binomial counts successes, and how Exponential, Gamma, and Poisson arise as continuous analogues or limits.

Key Takeaways:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Understanding distributions through their relationships provides intuition and makes them easier to remember and apply than rote memorization.
    \item Key relationships include: building blocks (Bernoulli), waiting times (Geometric, NegBin, Exponential, Gamma), counting (Binomial, Poisson), discrete/continuous analogies, and limiting behaviors.
    \item Summation properties reveal how distributions combine.
    \item Many other fascinating connections exist (t, Laplace, Cauchy, etc.), forming a rich structure within probability theory.
\end{itemize}

As the video suggests, visualizing these connections (perhaps using diagrams like the one mentioned showing interrelations) can be extremely helpful. Embrace this interconnected view; it will serve you well as you delve deeper into probability and statistics!
